        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inefficient Water Usage:</strong> Traditional plant watering methods often result in excessive or insufficient water supply, leading to plant stress and resource wastage.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-Consuming Manual Monitoring:</strong> Regularly checking soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels requires significant effort and is prone to inaccuracies.</li>
                       <li><strong>Limited Remote Access & Control:</strong> Farmers and gardeners lack the ability to monitor or adjust irrigation settings remotely, making plant care challenging.</li>
                       <li><strong>Energy Consumption & Sustainability Issues:</strong> Many irrigation systems consume excessive electricity, increasing costs and environmental impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Need for Automation & Smart Decision-Making:</strong> A smart system integrating IoT, AI, and real-time data analytics is required to optimize plant health and resource efficiency.</li>
